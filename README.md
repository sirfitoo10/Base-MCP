📦 Base MCP






A lightweight and extensible implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), designed to support AI agents, tool integrations, and context-aware systems.

🚀 Overview

Base MCP provides a simple foundation for building AI-powered systems that require structured context handling and external tool interaction. It is designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, making it suitable for both experimentation and production-oriented prototypes.

🧠 Core Concepts
Context Management
Handles structured input and maintains conversation or execution state.
Tool Interface
Provides a consistent way to integrate external functions and APIs.
Protocol Layer
Defines how data flows between components in a standardized format.
